// cow1.rs

// This exercise explores the Cow, or Clone-On-Write type.
// Cow is a clone-on-write smart pointer.
// It can enclose and provide immutable access to borrowed data, and clone the data lazily when mutation or ownership is required.
// The type is designed to work with general borrowed data via the Borrow trait.
//
// This exercise is meant to show you what to expect when passing data to Cow.
// Fix the unit tests by checking for Cow::Owned(_) and Cow::Borrowed(_) at the TODO markers.
